# Awesome C #

A curated list of C good stuff.

**An important note:** First and foremost linked resources are for C, therefore
C++ is an afterthought.

**Note:** there are several awesome-c lists already, but they are having
somewhat different sets of libraries in them. This list tries to incorporate
them all, and many more other resources. Consider it my personal cheat sheet and
index for easier search instead of github stars.
